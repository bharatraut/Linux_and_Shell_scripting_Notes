    The system is written in a high-level language, making it easy to read, understand, change, and move to tother machines.
    It has a simple user interface that has the power to provide the services that users want.
    It provides primitives that permit complex programs to be built from simpler programs.
    It uses a hierarchical file system that allows easy maintenance and efficient implementation.
    It uses a consistent format for files, the byte stream, making application programs easier to write.
    It provides a simple, consistent interface to peripheral devices.
    It is a multi-user, multiprocess system; each user can execute several processes simultaneously.
    It hides the machine architecture from the user, making it easier to write programs that run on different hardware implementations.
